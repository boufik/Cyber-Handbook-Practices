# Basic antenna types

| No | Antenna Type | Usage |
|:----:|:----|:----|
| 1 | Dipole | The most common antenna - widely used in radio, WiFi and TV broadcasting |
| 2 | Monopole | Not so efficient - used in old wireless devices like walkie-talkies, even in some mobile phones |
| 3 | Yagi-Uda | Widely used in digital TV broadcasting - characterized for its high gain and directionality |
| 4 | Parabolic | Often described as "dish" antenna - characterized for its high gain (higher than Yagi Uda's gain) and that is why it is mainly used in satellites, space communications as well as some radars |
| 5 | Log-Periodic | Consists of multiple dipoles (each dipole resonates at a frequency band, so all together create a wide-frequencies-capable antenna) - perfect for wide spectrum coverage scenarios like defense communications |
| 6 | Helical | Mainly used in GPS, satellites and spaceships - unique for its circual polarization of radio waves |
| 7 | Patch/microstrip | Used in a diverse set of applications like mobile phones, WiFi and aerospace |
| 8 | Loop antenna | Its main usage revolves around RFIDs and direction discovery scenarios |
