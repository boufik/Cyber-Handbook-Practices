# VirtualBox

* In `Name`, put something recognizable like `Test`.
* The default folder for storing VM-related data on Windows is `C:\Users\<username>\VirtualBox VMs`.
* In `ISO Image`: Supposing that we have downloaded `Ubuntu 24.04` ISO image under the Windows default download location (`Downloads`), simply select: `C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\ubuntu24_04.iso`
* By selecting the `ISO` image of the VM, some other fields are automatically filled: `Type` = `Linux`, `Subtype` = `Ubuntu` and `Version` = `Ubuntu (64-bit)`.
* Leave unselected the field named `Skil Unattended Istllation`
