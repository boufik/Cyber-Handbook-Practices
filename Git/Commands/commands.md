# 1. Basic Git commands

| No | Action | Command | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1  | Initialize a new Git repo | `git init` | `git init` creates a new `.git/` folder and **"converts" the directory into a Git repo**. |
| 2  | Set Git username | `git config --global user.name "<name>"` | `git config --global user.name "Thomas Thomas"`. Witout the `"<name>"`, Git prints the selected username. |
| 3  | Set Git email | `git config --global user.email "<email>"` | Must match your GitHub email for proper linking. Witout the `"<email>"`, Git prints the selected email. |
| 4  | Show current configuration | `git config --list` | Shows name, email, merge editor, etc. |
| | | | |
| 5  | Clone an existing remote repo with **HTTPS** | `git clone <repo_url>` | `git clone https://github.com/<user>/<project_name>.git)` |
| 6  | Clone an existing remote repo with **SSH** | `git clone <repo_url>` | `git clone git@github.com:<user>/<project_name>.git` |
| 7  | Track/Stage a file for the first time | `git add <file>` | `git add main.py` adds the file `main.py` in the staging area, before committing. |
| 8  | Track/Stage **all files** for the first time | `git add .` | Adds every file in the staging area, before committing. |
| 9  | Check the current repo status | `git status` | Shows untracked, modified, and staged files. |
| 10 | Commit any staged changes (that are in the staging area) with a message | `git commit -m "<message>"` | `git commit -m "Fixed login bug"` is useful for tracking our progress. |
| | | | |
| 11 | View commit history | `git log` | It can be combined with flags like `-3`, `--since` and `--until`. We can use `HEAD` and `HEAD~1` notation. Press `q` to exit the history view. |
| 12 | View compact commit history - An excellent way for visualizing branch history | `git log --oneline --graph --decorate` | It can also be combined with flags like `-5`. |
| 13 | Compare the **last committed version with latest version NOT IN the staging area** | `git diff` | Shows unstaged changes/differences. |
| 14 | Compare the **last committed version with latest version IN the staging area** (ready to commit) | `git diff --staged` | Shows staged changes/differences. |
| | | | |
| 15 | Undo **local unstaged** changes | `git restore <file>` | Restores the last committed version of a file. |
| 16 | Unstage a file (but keep the working changes) | `git restore --staged <file>` | The opposite command of `git add`. |
| | | | |
| 17 | Check what branch we are on | `git branch` | Lists local branches and **highlights the current one with green color**. |
| 18 | Create a new branch  | `git branch <branch_name>` | `git branch feature1_branch` |
| 19 | Switch to another branch | `git checkout <branch_name>` | `git checkout main` or `git checkout feature1_branch` |
| 20 | Create **AND** switch to a new branch in a **single command** | `git checkout -b <branch_name>` | `git checkout -b feature1_branch` |
| 21 | Delete a **local** branch (**safe only if merged**) | `git branch -d <branch_name>` | `git branch -d feature1_branch`. If `-D` is used instead, we force-delete a local branch. |
| 22 | Delete a **remote** branch | `git push origin --delete feature1_branch` | This is the best-practice workflow, after: pushing a local branch to a remote repo, creating a PR, accepting and manually merging the PR changes. |
| 23 | Show branch tracking info | `git branch -vv` | Indicates **which remote branch each local branch tracks**. |
| 24 | View remote-tracked branches | `git fetch --all` + `git branch -r` | Fetches all remote changes for viewing. |
| | | | |
| 25 | Push a **local branch to the remote repo**  | `git push -u origin <branch_name>` | In the remote repo, if there is NO branch named `<branch_name>`, a new PR will be created in order for peers to review and then manually merge the changes if there are NO conflicts - This is the **best-practice** |
| 26 | Pull the **latest remote** changes | `git pull origin <branch_name>` | `git pull origin main` â€” always do before pushing, like a method of syncing |
| 27 | Push committed changes to remote  | `git push`  | Sends all **local commits** on current branch. |
| 28 | View configured remotes | `git remote -v` | Lists fetch/push URLs for the repo. |
| | | | |
| 29 | Add a new remote repo | `git remote add origin <repo_url>` | `git remote add origin git@github.com:<user>/<new_project_name>.git` |
| 30 | Rename a remote | `git remote rename origin upstream` | Useful when **forking** projects. |
| 31 | Remove a remote | `git remote remove <name>` | `git remote remove upstream` |
